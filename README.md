# MovieMvc

This is an updated version of the MVC movies project with authentication and authorization using the Identity framework from .NET.
The project can be found here https://www.thecsharpacademy.com/project/28

### Challenges

The project overall was simple, as scaffolding the authentication stuff into a project is somewhat  extremely simple. I feel though i barely scratched the surface of it and it will take me a while to fully understand it.
Also, how to use identity with other fron't-end frameworks should also prove itself a bit more complicated.

That said, the most difficult part of this whole project was actually logging. 
The concept when i decided to create a repository to handle the logs was simple, but i fell that the oficial Microsoft documentantion leaves a lot to be desired.
They tell you about a lot of different tools and ways to do things but don't offer a conscise and to the point example of a simple implementation of logging in a normal crud application.

Overall, i feel i got out of this project understanding a bit about auth and logging, i feel a little bit less intimidated by this, but it's definetly a topic on itself that warrants more study. I hope the next auth projects will help with that.
