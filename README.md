# MovieMvc

MVC project for the csharp academy.

It was just following along the tutorial from microsoft but i can see already the benefits of razor pages over other front-end frameworks like react and angular.

Having everything in a single project, smart validation in the model and views that connect directly with the model are very practical compared to the amount of boilerplate, preparation and dependecies you have to set up with angular/react.

I'm very impressed so far.
